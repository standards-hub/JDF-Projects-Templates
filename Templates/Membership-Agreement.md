Sponsorship fees are subject to change during subsequent terms upon at least 90 days’ notice prior to expiration of the then current term.
    > Selecting this option means that the Series intends to collect funds from its members to fund operations.  Most projects do benefit from project support. You will find additional information about the specific support and benefits of project support in the Starting Up guide found at URL.  Collection of funds adds some important additional steps.  Projects will be assessed a fee of 9% of total Series' for the first $1 million of Revenue and 6% for Revenue beyond the first million dollars.  This fee defrays the costs of accounting, invoicing, collections, tax preparation, and the overhead associated with maintaining the Parent Series.  As with any Linux Foundation project, voting members are required to be a member of the Linux Foundation.  If a member is presently a member of the Linux Foundation no additional fees will apply.  If a member is not a member of the Linux Foundation, they will need to apply for Linux Foundation membership which will likely involve an additional fee.  The Sponsorship agreement found at the end of this application will have more information.

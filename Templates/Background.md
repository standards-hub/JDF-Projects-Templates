## Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC
### Background
The Joint Development Foundation and its subsidiaries are dedicated to helping standards, specification, source code, and related projects start quickly and operate efficiently.  Joint Development Foundation Projects are ideal for long term standards, specification source code projects, data projects, or as a place to do incubation projects before taking those projects to larger organizations. 

By using established Joint Development Foundation legal agreements, groups can establish projects quickly and with minimal legal expense.  By operating under the Joint Development Foundation’s legal umbrella, Projects can enjoy the benefits of Joint Development Foundation’s existing legal agreements, choice of intellectual property policies, non-profit status, and corporate structure.  This enables Projects to more easily establish themselves, collect funds, issue press releases in the Project’s name, develop liaison relationships, and hold copyrights, all without negotiating custom agreements and new corporate organizations.

The Joint Development Foundation operates under a freemium-type model, where projects can be established and operated without paying anything.  Projects can provide their own infrastructure (websites, email reflectors, conference organization, etc.), or can work with Joint Development Foundation approved vendors to provide these types of services if they wish.
